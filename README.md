# Pandemic Nexus: A COVID-19 Database Project

## Introduction

I worked on a **COVID-19 database project** to design and implement an **efficient database management system (DBMS)** for organizing, tracking, and analyzing COVID-19 data. This system allows for **real-time reporting**, **data integration**, and better insights into cases, testing, treatment, and vaccination trends.  

The **goal** was to create a **centralized platform** that could support healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in making **data-driven decisions**.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Organization:** Built a structured relational database to efficiently store and retrieve COVID-19-related data.  

- **Real-time Reporting:** Implemented mechanisms for up-to-date reporting and visualization.  

- **Interconnected Information:** Created relationships between entities to enable comprehensive analysis.  

- **User Accessibility:** Developed an easy-to-use interface for healthcare professionals to input, update, and retrieve data.

## Conceptual Design

The **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** was developed based on real-world pandemic data management requirements. This helped in structuring the **relational schema**, ensuring **data consistency and efficient queries**.  

The database was designed using **MySQL**, with **tables normalized to 3rd Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate redundancy and improve query performance.

## Database Schema and Implementation

### **Table Creation**
A total of **15 tables** were created to structure the data. The relationships were carefully defined using **foreign keys** to maintain referential integrity.  

### **Data Population**
To test the database, sample data was inserted, and a **data scraping tool** (written in Perl) was used to fetch real-world COVID-19 data.

## SQL Implementation

### **Database Creation**
## Query Scenarios
### Retrieve Patient Information with City Names
SELECT P.PatientID, P.FirstName, P.LastName, P.DateOfBirth, P.Gender, C.CityName 
FROM Patients P 
JOIN City C ON P.CityID = C.CityID;
### Find the Count of Different Mask Types Used
SELECT MaskType, COUNT(*) AS UsageCount 
FROM Mask 
JOIN COVID_Result ON Mask.MaskID = COVID_Result.MaskID 
GROUP BY MaskType 
ORDER BY UsageCount;
### Get the Total Number of Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries
SELECT SUM(TotalCases) AS TotalCases, SUM(TotalDeaths) AS TotalDeaths, SUM(TotalRecovered) AS TotalRecovered 
FROM Statistics;
### Identify Regions with the Most Hospitals
SELECT R.RegionName, COUNT(H.HospitalID) AS TotalHospitals 
FROM Region R 
LEFT JOIN City C ON R.RegionID = C.RegionID 
LEFT JOIN Hospitals H ON C.CityID = H.CityID 
GROUP BY R.RegionName 
ORDER BY TotalHospitals DESC LIMIT 1;
These queries provided real-time insights into pandemic trends, treatment effectiveness, and regional healthcare readiness.

## Challenges Faced
### Data Collection & Integration
Consolidating COVID-19 data from hospitals, testing centers, and public health agencies was challenging due to varying formats.
To ensure uniformity, I implemented data transformation and validation techniques.
### Data Accuracy & Completeness
Missing and inconsistent data posed challenges, so I applied data validation methods and missing value imputation to maintain data integrity.
### Efficient Query Execution
•	With large datasets, performance optimization was crucial.

•	Used indexing, query optimization, and a well-structured schema to enhance retrieval speed and system efficiency.
________________________________________
### Power BI Dashboard
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize COVID-19 data effectively.
Key Observations:
•	Recovery Rates: Displayed a real-time count of recovered cases compared to WHO reports.

•	Mask Usage Trends: Analysis showed Cloth (34%) and KN95 (34%) as the most used masks.


•	Medication Analysis: Ivermectin (34%) and Paracetamol (17%) were the most commonly used medications.

•	Geographical Recovery Disparities: Recovery trends were visualized across different regions using a heatmap.
The dashboard enabled real-time decision-making, helping authorities track infection rates, vaccination progress, and hospital capacities.

### Key Takeaways & Insights
•	The database allows healthcare professionals to track COVID trends in real-time.

•	By integrating hospital and patient data, policymakers can allocate resources more effectively.


•	Predictive modeling based on query results can help forecast pandemic trends and prepare for future outbreaks.

•	Interactive dashboards facilitate easy interpretation of vast amounts of data for stakeholders.

## Conclusion
This COVID-19 database system empowers healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers by providing a centralized platform for pandemic tracking and analysis.
With real-time reporting, structured queries, and interactive dashboards, this project enhances decision-making and public health strategies.
By leveraging MySQL for structured data storage and Power BI for visualization, I was able to transform raw pandemic data into meaningful insights, contributing to better crisis management and preparedness for future public health challenges.
